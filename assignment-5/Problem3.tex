% Devise an MST algorithm for a particular family of graphs

We focus on the family of graphs which have a subset of $k$ edges whose removal turns the graph into a tree. Let $G = (E, V)$ a graph of this family and $E' \subseteq E$ the subset of edges of size $|E'| = k$.

If edges are not weighted (or all have unit weight), any tree of $G$ is an MST. Therefore $G' = (E \backslash E', V)$ is an MST. We can build $G'$ in linear time using Depth-First search in $G$:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start at any vertex $v$.
  \item Explore the graph in a depth-first fashion:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each time a new node is encountered, mark it as visited and add the edge used to the MST.
    \item If an edge $e$ allows to go from the current vertex to a previously visited vertex, then it must be part of the cycle. We do not include $e$ in the MST.
  \end{itemize}
  \item When all nodes have been marked, we obtain a Minimum Spanning Tree.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Since each node and edge are used exactly once, the algorithm obtains an MST in time $O(|V| + |E|)$.
