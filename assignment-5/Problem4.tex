% Uniqueness of a maximum bipartite matching depending on the number of vertices and edges

\section{A connected bipartite graph on $2n+1$ vertices does not have a unique maximum matching}

Denote the connected bipartite graph as $G = (X \cup Y, E)$. We suppose that there exists a unique maximum matching, denoted $M$.

Because we have odd numbers of vertices, and a matching can only cover even numbers of vertices, there must exist a vertex which is not covered by $M$, denoted $v$. Without loss of generality, we suppose $v \in X$.

As this is a connected bipartite graph, there must exist a vertex $w \in Y$, such that there's an edge between $v$ and $w$. $w$ must be in the maximum matching $M$, otherwise we could add an edge $(v,w)$ to $M$ to make a bigger matching.

Now consider the edge in $M$ which points to $w$. We denote the other vertex of the edge as $v'$. We have $v' \in X$ because $w \in Y$. Then consider the matching $M'$ which is formed by removing edge $(v',w)$ from $M$ and ading edge $(v, w)$. It's obvious $M'$ is also a maximum matching, so we conclude that the maximum matching is not unique.

\section{The maximum number of edges for a unique maximum matching is $2n-1$}

For easier discussion, let's denote the graph as $G = (X \cup Y, E)$. The claim above follows trivially from the two propositions below.

\subsection{There's no unique maximum matching if there are more than $2n-1$ edges}

Suppose there's a unique maximum matching which we denote $M$. If there are more than $2n-1$ edges in a graph, then from graph theory we know there's at least one cycle $C$ in the graph. In the case of a bipartite graph, we can prove following properties about $C$:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The cycle has an even number of edges. Indeed, by traversing $C$, we must travel even rounds between $X$ and $Y$ in order to get back to the origin.
  \item The cycle has an even number of vertices. Since in any cycle, the number of vertices and edges are the same, this follows from the previous claim.
  \item Half of the edges of the cycle are in $X$, half are in $Y$. When traversing around the cycle, we travel back and forth between $X$ and $Y$ without passing any vertex twice in the middle, so half of the vertices are in $X$, and the other half in $Y$.
  \item All vertices of the cycle are matched in the unique maximum match $M$. If there exists one vertex which is not matched in $M$, following the same argument as in the previous section, we can show that either $M$ is not the maximum matching or $M$ is not unique.
\end{enumerate}

Because all vertices of cycle $C$ are in the unique maximum matching $M$, then we have:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All edges of $C$ in the maximum matching are not consecutive, otherwise a vertex would have two edges in $M$, which then couldn't possibly be a matching.
  \item Exactly half the edges of the cycle $C$ are in the maximum matching, otherwise some vertex would not be matched in $M$.
\end{enumerate}

From the two observations above, we can create another maximum matching by replacing the half of edges of cycle $C$ in the maximum matching $M$ by the other half of the edges. Thus the maximum matching $M$ is also not unique in this case.

To summarize, if there are more than $2n-1$ edges in a connected bipartite graph of $2n$ vertices, then there's no unique maximum matching.

\subsection{There exists a connected bipartite graph of $2n-1$ edges which has unique maximum matching}

Consider the connected bipartite graph where the degree of each vertex is at most 2. Visually this is a curve with $2n-1$ edges and $2n$ vertices. The unique maximum matching is the set of odd-numbered edges of the curve. Other choices of matching are not maximum.
