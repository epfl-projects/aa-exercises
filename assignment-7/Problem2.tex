% Time-optimized global alignment algorithm (not yielding the optimal solution)

We aim to modify the aligment dynamic programming algorithm such that it does not guarantee an optimal solution, but have better time and space performance. We assume the two strings to be matched have length $n$. Let $t$ the value of a threshold.

If the edit distance (i.e. distance to the diagonal path in the edit matrix) exceeds $t$ in any direction, we stop considering the solution. In order to integrate this behavior in the existing DP algorithm, we propose the following modifications.

\textbf{Cost function}: We modify the cost evaluation to:
\[
  DP[i][j] = \left \{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \infty & \text{if } |i - j| > t \\
      \text{Previous cost definition} & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
\]

Then we notice that we need only evaluate cells $(i, j)$ such that $|i - j| > t$. There are at most $2t$ such cells per line. We may use a single vector representation along with a coordinates translation scheme to avoid storing an $n \times n$ matrix. With minor modifications on the algorithm's main loop bounds, we bring both time and memory performance to $O(2tn)$.
