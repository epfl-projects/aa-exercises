Let us name \texttt{next} the given lexicographic permutation algorithm. Let us show that \texttt{next} has $O(1)$ amortized performance.

In an array $a$ with $n$ elements, we denote $q$ the number of elements such that $a[k] > a[k+1]$. At any time, we denote $m$ the length of the strictly non-increasing suffix of $a$.
We then define the potential function $\Phi$ as:
\[
  \Phi(a) = 3 * q
\]

We must show that $\exists \alpha$ such that:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:amortized}
  C_{real} + \Delta\Phi \leq \alpha
\end{equation}

Note that $m \leq 0$ cannot occur since a single-element sequence is trivially non-increasing. We thus distinguish two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When $m = 1$ and the initial potential is $\Phi = q$.\\
By definition, the algorithm finds $k = n - 1 - m = n - 2$ and $k + 1 = n - 1$ (the last element of the array) in constant time by searching from the end of the array. We set this cost to 1 unit.\\
$l$ must also equal $n - 1$, since it is the largest possible index for which $a[k] < a[l]$. This is determined with cost 1. \texttt{next} swaps $a[k]$ and $a[k+1]$ in constant time 1. Reversing the array from $k + 1$ to the end does nothing, since this sequence is of length 1.\\
After swapping, we have $a[k] > a[k + 1]$, which corresponds to an increase of $q$ by 1.\\

The change of potential is then $\Delta\Phi = 3 * (q+1) - 3 * q = +3$. The real cost amounts to 3 (constant time). Substituting in equation \ref{eq:amortized} yields:
\[
  C_{real} + \Delta\Phi = (1 + 1 + 1) + 3 = 6 \leq \alpha
\]
which holds $\forall \alpha >= 6$.

  \item When $m > 1$ and the initial potential is $\Phi = q$.\\
By definition, the algorithm finds $k = n - 1 - m$ and $k + 1 = n - m$ (the first element of the strictly non-increasing suffix) in time $m$ by searching from the end of the array.\\
Searching for the index $l$ take at most $m$ comparisons, since we know that $a[k] < a[k+1]$. The swap takes constant time 1. Reversing the array from $k + 1$ to the end takes $m / 2$ swaps (we will simplify this to a cost $m$).\\
After performing the reverse, the sequence $a[k+1]...a[n-1]$ of length $m$ is in weakly increasing order, which corresponds to a decrease of $q$ by $m$.\\

The change of potential is then $\Delta\Phi = 3 * (q - m) - 3 * q = -3 * m$. The real cost amounts to $3 * m + 1$. Substituting in equation \ref{eq:amortized} yields:
\[
  C_{real} + \Delta\Phi \leq (m + m + 1 + m) - 3 * m = 1 \leq \alpha
\]
which also holds $\forall \alpha >= 1$.
\end{enumerate}

Equation \ref{eq:amortized} holds for all cases, therefore \texttt{next} generates the next lexicographic permutation in constant amortized time.
