% Solve the recurrence relation for the running time of the global alignment algorithm

We are given the following recurrence relation describing the running time of the divide-and-conquer modification of the DP algorithm for global alignment:
\[
  T(m, n) = T(j, \frac{n}{2}) + T(m - j, \frac{n}{2}) + \theta(m, n)
\]
\noindent
with $j$ the index of the column chosen after running two alignment instances over the top and bottom half of the matrix.
