Let $T$ be the total times of skis. We first show that the optimal strategy OPT is as follows:

\[ f(T) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    \text{rent skis} & \quad \text{if $T < N$}  \\
    \text{buy cheap skis} & \quad \text{if $N \leq T \leq 2N$} \\
    \text{buy cheap skis and rent $T - 2N$} & \quad \text{if $2N < T < 3N$} \\
    \text{buy expensive skis} & \quad \text{if $T \geq 3N$}\\
  \end{array} \right.
\]

\noindent
The reasons are given below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{$T < N$}. In this case, rent costs less than $N$, while the other two choices will cost at least $N$.

\item \textbf{$N \leq T \leq 2N$}. In this case, buy cheap skis costs $N$, while the other two choices will cost more than $N$.

\item \textbf{$2N < T < 3N$}. In this case, buy cheap skis and rent $T-2N$ times will cost less than $2N$, while other two choices will cost at least $2N$.

\item \textbf{$T \geq 3N$}. In this case, buy expensive costs $2N$, while no combination of the other two choices would cost less than $2N$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
We propose following online algorithm:

\[Online(n) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    \text{rent skis} & \quad \text{if $n < N$}  \\
    \text{buy cheap skis} & \quad \text{if $n = N$}  \\
    \text{use cheap skis} & \quad \text{if $N < n < 3N$} \\
    \text{buy expensive skis} & \quad \text{if $n = 3N$} \\
    \text{use expensive skis} & \quad \text{if $n > 3N$}\\
  \end{array} \right.
\]

\noindent
We compare the performance below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  Ski Times & Cost(OPT) & Cost(Online) & Ratio \\
  \hline
  $[1, N)$ & T & T & 1 \\
  \hline
  $[N, 2N]$ & N & 2N & 2 \\
  \hline
  $(2N, 3N)$ & T - N & 2N & $(1, 2)$ \\
  \hline
  $[3N, \infty)$ & 2N & 4N & 2 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
So our strategy is at most 2 times worse than the optimal strategy.
