\section{Comparison with the fully randomized algorithm}
  We denote $S_{k, m}$ the event ``our algorithm found the mincut with parameter values $k$ and $m$''. We denote $\Pr(S_{k, m})$ the associated probability, and $\Pr_0(S_m)$ the probability of success of the original, fully randomized algorithm over $m$ runs.

  \noindent
  As derived in the lecture notes, the original algorithm achieves the following performance:
  \[
    {\Pr}_0(S_m) = (1 - \f{2}{n(n-1)})^m
  \]

  \noindent
  In our case, we fixed the reference to $m = 2$, so our algorithm must compete with $\Pr_0(S_2) = (1 - \f{2}{n(n-1)})^2$.
