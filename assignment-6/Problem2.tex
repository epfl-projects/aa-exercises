% Moving to another town (as a network flow problem)
Say out of $n$ branches $x$ branches are moved to a new city (say city $B$) while the remaining $n-x$ branches remain in the same city (say city $A$). If that is the case, the total cost incurred is as follows:

\begin{center}
$c = \sum\limits_{i \in A} a_i + \sum\limits_{i \in B} b_i + \sum\limits_{i, j: i \in A and j \in B} c_{ij} $
\end{center}


Now lets reformulate the problem as a network flow problem. Let all $n$ branches denote the vertices in a graph $G$. All these vertices have edges to all the other vertices except themselves. We set the capacity of such edges to be $c_{ij}$ (which is the same as the cost incurred if the branches $i$ and $j$ were in different cities). Also we introduce a source $s$ and a sink $t$. Now we add edges from source to all the vertices and set the capacities of such edges to $b_i$ for each edge $(s, v_i)$, where $v_i$ is vertex $i$. And for the sink, we add edges $(v_i,t)$ from all the vertices to the sink and label their capacities as $a_i$. Now any cut $(A, B)$ in such a graph would have the following capacity. 


\begin{center}
$c'(A, B) = \sum\limits_{i \in A} a_i + \sum\limits_{i \in B} b_i + \sum\limits_{i, j: i \in A and j \in B} c_{ij} $
\end{center}

We can see that the capacity $c$ and cost $c'$ are the same. Hence finding an assignment that minimizes the cost is same as finding a min-cut in graph $G$. The vertices in the source side of the cut would then represent branches that remain in the same city while the vertices in the sink side of the cut would represent branches that are moved to the new city under optimum assignment.
