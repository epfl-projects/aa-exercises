% Influence of the capacities in the network (mincut / maxflow)

Let us denote the original network as $N$, the network with capacity of each edge increased by 1 as $N_{+1}$, and the network with capacity of of each edge decreased by 1 as $N_{-1}$. Then we have following facts:

\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
    maxflow(N)      & = F \\
    maxflow(N_{+1}) & = F + \Delta_1 \\
    maxflow(N_{-1}) & = F - \Delta_2
  \end{array}
\]

Now consider a new network $N\prime$, which is created from the juxtaposition of networks $N_{+1}$ and $N_{-1}$. We add a new source and sink, connected respectively to the sources and sinks of $N_{+1}$ and $N_{-1}$ by edges with infinite capacity.

Next we prove the following two facts about the network $N\prime$, from which the conclusion follows trivially.

\section{The maxflow of $N\prime$ is $2F + \Delta_1 - \Delta_2$}

According to the \textit{Mincut-Maxflow theorem}, we know that:

\[
  \begin{array}{lclcl}
    capacity(mincut(N_{+1})) & = & maxflow(N_{+1}) & = & F + \Delta_1 \\
    capacity(mincut(N_{-1})) & = & maxflow(N_{-1}) & = & F - \Delta_2
  \end{array}
\]

For network $N\prime$, subnetworks $N_{+1}$ and $N_{-1}$ are the only two possible paths from the source to the sink. Moreover, we only added edges of infinite capacity when forming $N\prime$. Thus:
\[
  capacity(mincut(N\prime)) = capacity(mincut(N_{+1})) + capacity(mincut(N_{-1})) = 2F + \Delta_1 - \Delta_2
\]

Using the \textit{mincut-maxflow thereom}, the capacity of the mincut of a network is equal to its maxflow, so the maxflow of $(N\prime)$ is $2F + \Delta_1 - \Delta_2$.

\section{The maxflow of $N\prime$ is less than $2F$}

Consider the edges $E$ included in the mincut of the original network $N$. Denote these \textbf{same} edges in networks $N_{+1}$ and $N_{-1}$ as $E_{+1}$ and $E_{-1}$ respectively. Suppose the mincut $E$ has $k$ edges, then we have the following:

\[
  \begin{array}{c}
    capacity(E_{+1}) = F + k \\
    capacity(E_{-1}) = F - k
  \end{array}
\]

\noindent
Now consider network $N\prime$. It's obvious that the set of edges $E_{+1} \cup E_{-1}$ forms a cut of $N\prime$. Then we have:

\[
  \begin{array}{lllll}
    capacity(mincut(N\prime)) & \leq & capacity(E_{+1} \cup E_{-1}) & = & 2F
  \end{array}
\]

From the \textit{mincut-maxflow thereom} and the previous result, we obtain:
\[
  \begin{array}{lrl}
         & maxflow(N\prime)         & \leq 2F \\
    \iff & 2F + \Delta_1 - \Delta_2 & \leq 2F \\
    \iff & \Delta_1                 & \leq \Delta_2 \\
  \end{array}
\]
